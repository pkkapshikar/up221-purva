### About me

Hi! I'm Purva Kapshikar, and I'm a second-year Master of Urban Planning Student concentrating in Transportation Planning and Policy. I'm originally from the (East) Bay Area, and I went to UC Berkeley for undergrad. 

### Course description

UP 221 covers Python and GIS fundamentals for analyzing and visualizing spatial and nonspatial data.

### Project ideas

I would like to work with GTFS data to determine locations of bus stops where real-time information could be useful for passengers. 

### Objectives for the course

I want to familiar myself with more Python libraries for working with spatial data.
